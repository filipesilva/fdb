# unreleased

- simpler first demo, moved current ones to more-demos
  - hopefully makes you feel like you're getting superpowers
  - thanks to @escherize for the feedback!
- added default `load-repl.fdb.clj` and `server-repl.fdb.clj` to load vec
  - felt it would be nice to have a place for loaded and server stuff
- email send/sync/split-mbox
- mac notification
- removed mentions of first class `:fdb/tags`
  - nothing really used them, and you can add whatever key you want for it
- shell triggers run on parent dir
